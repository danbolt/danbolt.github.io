I currently live in the all-too-perfect city of Victoria, British Columbia, and recently graduated from the University of Victoria with a Bachelor's in Computer Science.<\/p><p>My interests include video games, programming languages, hiking, and cooking. I particularily enjoy drinking coffee on Saturday afternoons with my friends. My favourite book is The Brothers Karamazov by Fyodor Dostoyevsky.<\/p><p>Someday, I hope to have developed a bunch of fun video games, become a versatile cook, and maybe even finish something published by ATLUS. The third one is a bit of a long-shot though.<\/p>"
